### Technologies Used
* jQuery library for DOM Manipulation, very helpful to create a smooth scroll
* Slick library used for creating the carousel feature.


### Process and Approach
* Started with researching for ideas.
* Sketched out a basic wireframe and laid out the next major steps to tackle.
* Added structure to the html page, followed by simple block styling to see where all the elements on the page where.
* Then tackled bigger problems, like how to make a Carousel. I research libraries: Bootstraps, Materialize, and Slick. Then I played around with each till I found the one that fit my needs for this project. I decided to use Slick, since I only planned to use this for the Carousel feature, I didn't need the others.
* Lastly, I tackled the mobile responsiveness with Media Queries.


#### Cycle of Process
* Research
* Play around with test code
* Add content
* Clean it all up


### Unsolved Problems
* Refine content to reflect me in the about section
* Incorporate a visual theme to reflect my path from screen printing to web development
* Wasn't quite sure how to add a lightbox feature to the carousel.
* Wanted to make the contact form more responsive with border that highlight when that input field is clicked on.


### Biggest wins and challenges
* Challenge: was getting started from a blank page and without a clear idea and working past it.
* Challenge: not thinking clearly, because I was in panic mode racing against the clock, and working through it. For example getting my nav bar, logo, and hamburger icon to layout nicely on a desktop and mobile. By laying nav bars on top of each other just to get it to align properly, given more time I'm sure I can find a cleaner way to do this.
* Success: getting the Testimonials to rotate and fadeIn on a cycle.
* Success: getting a very basic parallax scrolling to work.
